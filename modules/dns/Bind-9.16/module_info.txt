BIND 9.16.5 / 64 bit / Command Line Arguments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage: named [-4|-6] [-c conffile] [-d debuglevel] [-E engine] [-f|-g]
             [-n number_of_cpus] [-p port] [-s] [-S sockets] [-t chrootdir]
             [-u username] [-U listeners] [-m {usage|trace|record|size|mctx}]
usage: named [-v|-V]
named: extra command line arguments

-4
    Use IPv4 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv6.
    -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.
-6
    Use IPv6 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv4.
    -4 and -6 are mutually exclusive.
-c config-file
    Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the default,
    /etc/named.conf. To ensure that reloading the configuration file
    continues to work after the server has changed its working directory
    due to to a possible directory option in the configuration file,
    config-file should be an absolute pathname.
-d debug-level
    Set the daemon's debug level to debug-level. Debugging traces from
    named become more verbose as the debug level increases.
-E engine-name
    Use a crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine) for the crypto operations it
    supports, for instance re-signing with private keys from a secure key
    store. When compiled with PKCS#11 support engine-name defaults to
    pkcs11, the empty name resets it to no engine.
-f
    Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not daemonize).
-g
    Run the server in the foreground and force all logging to stderr.
-m flag
    Turn on memory usage debugging flags. Possible flags are usage, trace,
    record, size, and mctx. These correspond to the ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX
    flags described in <isc/mem.h>.
-n #cpus
    Create #cpus worker threads to take advantage of multiple CPUs.
    If not specified, named will try to determine the number of CPUs
    present and create one thread per CPU. If it is unable to determine
    the number of CPUs, a single worker thread will be created.
-p port
    Listen for queries on port port. If not specified, the default is port 53.
-s
    Write memory usage statistics to stdout on exit.
    Note: This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers and may
    be removed or changed in a future release.
-S #max-socks
    Allow named to use up to #max-socks sockets.
    Warning: This option should be unnecessary for the vast majority of
    users. The use of this option could even be harmful because the
    specified value may exceed the limitation of the underlying system API.
    It is therefore set only when the default configuration causes
    exhaustion of file descriptors and the operational environment is known
    to support the specified number of sockets. Note also that the actual
    maximum number is normally a little fewer than the specified value
    because named reserves some file descriptors for its internal use.
-t directory
    Chroot to directory after processing the command line arguments, but
    before reading the configuration file.
    Warning: This option should be used in conjunction with the -u option,
    as chrooting a process running as root doesn't enhance security on
    most systems; the way chroot(2) is defined allows a process with root
    privileges to escape a chroot jail.
-u user
    Setuid to user after completing privileged operations, such as
    creating sockets that listen on privileged ports.
    Note: On Linux, named uses the kernel's capability mechanism to drop
    all root privileges except the ability to bind(2) to a privileged port
    and set process resource limits.
-v
    Report the version number and exit.
-V
    Report the version number and build options, and exit.
-x cache-file
    Load data from cache-file into the cache of the default view.
    Warning: This option must not be used. It is only of interest to
    BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed in a future release.
